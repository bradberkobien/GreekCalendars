GreekCalendars

Presently, Greek Life Rush calendars are not available in a central location, nor in a unified format. This can make it difficult for students who wish to become involved in Greek Life to find, plan for, and join Rush events hosted by Kettering University fraternities and sororities.

Our proposal is to design and prototype a web interface that will host a unified Greek Life Rush calendar for each year.  Each fraternity and sorority on campus is already required to submit to the university their calendar of Rush events annually. This policy makes our proposal feasible. As the university collects the information in one place, we may consolidate the information readily, and host them via our proposed web interface through Kettering. With this one calendar, it will be easier for students to view events that are hosted by each fraternity or sorority.  They will be able to access the information at anytime and anywhere.  We will utilize Google Calendar to manipulate the calendars that are provided by each house to create a new unified calendar for all of Greek Life. Google Calendar will not only assist in calendar plotting, but Kettering students are already very familiar with Googleâ€™s suite of tools, which Kettering uses for email hosting. This seamless integration, coupled with critical organization will make the proposal a success.
